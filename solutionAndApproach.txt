solution

    The solution is a set of endpoints built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), 
    web framework for building APIs. The API provides functionality to get and filter trades, 
    as well as pagination for the trades.

    The solution includes the following endpoints:

    -->  /trades: An endpoint that returns all the trades from the database.
    -->  /trades/{id}: An endpoint that returns a trade by its ID.
    -->  /trades/search={query}: An endpoint that returns trades matching the search query, 
            which can be a substring of the trade's counterparty, instrumentId, instrumentName, or trader.
    -->  /tradesfiltered: An endpoint that returns trades filtered based on their asset class, 
            trade date time range, trade price range, and trade type (buy or sell).
    -->  /paginatedtrades: An endpoint that returns trades in a paginated manner, where the page number and 
            the number of trades per page can be specified.

Reasoning behind the approach

    The approach is to build an API that is easy to use, efficient, and scalable. FastAPI is a good choice because 
    it is a modern framework that provides automatic data validation, documentation, 
    and code generation, making it easy to build and maintain APIs.

    The endpoints are designed to cover a range of use cases for getting and filtering trades. /trades 
    returns all trades in the database, which is useful when the user wants to get a quick overview of all the trades. 
    /trades/{id} returns a specific trade by its ID, which is useful when the user wants to get detailed information 
    about a particular trade. /trades/search={query} is useful when the user wants to search for trades based on a specific keyword. 
    /tradesfiltered returns trades based on various filters, such as asset class, trade date time range, trade price range, 
    and trade type (buy or sell). /paginatedtrades returns trades in a paginated manner, 
    which is useful when the user wants to view a subset of the trades.

    The database used is MongoDB, a NoSQL document database that is scalable, flexible, and easy to use. MongoDB is a good choice 
    because it is fast, can handle large amounts of data, and can scale horizontally.
